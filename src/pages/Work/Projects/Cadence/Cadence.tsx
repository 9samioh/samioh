            I worked on Cadenceâ€™s frontend engineering team, taking features
            from beginning to end in cycles of 6 weeks for their remote patient
            monitoring application. I worked on a lot of tech debt sprints to
            clean up the application in small features, and below are three
            large, clinician-facing features I worked on!

        <Banner
          title="Multi-select Location"
          info="Because clinicians could only filter patients by a singular hospital name, they found it extremeley difficult to look through patients when they often had patients from multiple hospitals. After working closely with designers on the team, I developed the multi-select filtering for hospital locations. This feature was actually deployed shortly after I left the company, and it was exciting to hear about the feedback and impact that this had made on the clinicians' workflows."

        </Stack>

        <Banner
          title="Priority Alerts"
          info="I worked on the alerts team for one cycle during the summer, and we developed three different alert priorities for clinicians to better prioritize patients. Each of the alert thresholds were calculated based on the patient's specific chronic illness (ex: Type 2 Diabetes or Hypertension) and then shown by three different icons. The icons also had multiple variants and hover states to describe more detail about the readings on first glance."

        <Banner
          title="Form Error Messages"
          info="My first big feature that I worked on was creating error messages for medical forms filled out by clinicians. I added in-line error messages, red titles, and red outlines to the schema driven forms as well as descriptive error messages on the side, shown on submission."
