            We created a public-facing web application for NBJC where
            organizations that staff has approved can enter their information so
            that they can be easily found by users on the platform. NBJC staff
            has the ability to moderate and remove organizations from the
            platform if necessary. Organizations on the platform also have the
            ability to raise awareness about cultural or political events they
            are hosting while benefiting from a network of similar groups. The
            aim is to help individuals find and contribute to local
            organizations that are working to help Black LGBTQ/SGL+ and other
            marginalized communities.
